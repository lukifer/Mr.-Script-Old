Mr. Script is a spoilerific enhancement for the web MMO [Kingdom of Loathing](http://kingdomofloathing.com). You'll need [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for it to do anything useful. See [this thread](http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showthread.php?t=182885) for more information.

My deepest thanks to Hellion, Ohayou, and everyone else who has contributed and maintained this project. All pull requests welcomed! (Except for fingers.)
